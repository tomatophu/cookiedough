# Cookiedough

An archive of a cookie clicker inspired game that I worked a year on but eventually gave up. I started this when I was extremely sub-par at programming and such the source code is INCREDIBLY messy.

Things to note:
 - Running this source code requires Python 3.12 or above
 - The required modules to install are in the "requirements.txt" file
 - The Font files are not included as they are copyrighted material (you can buy them at https://pixbob.itch.io/pixbob-fonts)
 - The source code is pretty messy
